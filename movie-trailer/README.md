  1. `/api` - represents a more advanced project implementation with a dynamic recuperation of the movie data from two external sources via APIs, use of *flask* and modification of the HTML and the CSS styles.
  2. `/standard` - contains all the files related a more basic implementation of the project with the static movie database in the `entertainment_center.py` file and some modification of HTML and CSS.
